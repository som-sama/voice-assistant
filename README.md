STT format and get results from GPT
# What I am trying to do
1) Creating the frontend using React and Nextjs to create a user interface that allows user to record their voices and submit it as input to the application.

2) Integrating STT: Google cloud speech to text, amazon transcribe and microsoft azure speech servies

3) Sending the transcribed text to gpt api

4) Parse and display the results. Once the results are recieved from the GPT API, we gotta parse the data and display it to the user. Can use NextJS and ReactJS to create a dynamic interface that updates in real-time as the user speaks and as new results are generated.
